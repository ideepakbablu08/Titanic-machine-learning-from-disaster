## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This project utilizes a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the disaster.

## Data Exploration

The dataset provided by Kaggle includes the following features:
- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger
- `Survived`: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Name`: Name of the passenger
- `Sex`: Gender
- `Age`: Age in years
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
- `Parch`: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Initial Data Analysis

Initial analysis involves understanding the distribution of various features and their correlation with the target variable (`Survived`). This can include:
- Summary statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and box plots

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. Steps include:
- Handling missing values: Strategies such as imputation or removal of missing data points
- Encoding categorical variables: Converting categorical features into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the model's performance
- Normalization/standardization: Scaling features to a similar range

## Model Building

Multiple machine learning algorithms can be tested to find the best performing model. Common algorithms include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Each model's performance can be evaluated using cross-validation and appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the model on the validation/test dataset. Key steps include:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training the model on the training set
- Evaluating the model on the test set
- Analyzing metrics and visualizing results using confusion matrix, ROC curves, etc.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the project, the performance of the model, and potential improvements. Discuss any limitations and future work that could be done to enhance the model.
