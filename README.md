# Titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster
This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, and class.

## Project Structure

- `requirements.txt`: The list of dependencies required to run the notebook (not included in this readme but should be created).
- `data/`: Directory containing the data files (if any).

## Installation
